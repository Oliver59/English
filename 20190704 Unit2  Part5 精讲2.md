- 现在进行时动词变形规则

  - 1、一般动词，直接+ing
    - blow → blowing
    - rain → raining
  - 2、以不发音字母e结尾的动词去e，再+ing
    - come → coming
    - have → having
    - write → writing
    - **see 里面的e是发音的，所以直接加ing  see → seeing**
  - 3、以重读闭音节结尾的动词，双写最后的辅音字母，再+ing
    - 重读闭音节：首先，这个音节的组成得是元音+辅音的结构，并且这个音节中的元音字母发短元音。
    - put → putting
    - run → running
  - 以ie结尾的动词，它们需要改ie为y，再+ing
    - die → dying
